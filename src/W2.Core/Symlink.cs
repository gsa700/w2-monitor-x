/// derives from <see cref="IOException"/>, so a caller that wraps the whole create-if-needed sequence
/// in <c>catch (IOException)</c> silently turns "no link yet" into "give up", and the link is then
/// never created on that launch or any later one. Asking where a link points is a question that
