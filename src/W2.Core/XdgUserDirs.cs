/// <c>~/Escritorio</c>, <c>~/Bureau</c>, <c>~/デスクトップ</c> — and a user can point it anywhere or
/// switch it off entirely. Writing a launcher to a hardcoded <c>~/Desktop</c> on such a machine
/// creates a stray folder holding a file nobody will ever see.
///
/// Pure parsing, given the file's contents: the format is quoted, <c>$HOME</c>-relative and
/// comment-bearing, which is three ways to get it subtly wrong on a machine that isn't in front of
/// you. The v0.7.0-beta symlink bug came from trusting a BCL call's behaviour on Linux without
