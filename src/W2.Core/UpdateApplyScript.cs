/// no write permission) would relaunch the OLD exe while the UI had already said "restarting to
/// apply…", i.e. a silent false success. Here the copy result is checked: on success the new build
/// relaunches; on failure a marker file is dropped (the app surfaces it on next start) and the old
/// exe is relaunched anyway so the user is never left without a running app.
